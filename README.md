## IAQ (Infrequently asked questions)

> *Why is your code so shit?*

 Because i made it in about 2 days without knowing any Xlib beforehand, or really much C.

> *Why are the bitmaps embedded?*

 Because i felt like it, I don't know. I will probably make it load from files later to reduce memory usage & because you can't switch characters while running.

> *Why did you write it in Xlib?*

 Because i felt like it, and because it can probably run on ancient versions of Solaris and shit so you can make cool screenshots for /g/

> *Will you add more characters?*

 Probably

> *How do I build it?*

 Run build.sh

> *Can you provide binaries?*

 No

> *How do I use it?*

 Run awcharse [character], and left-click to cycle outfits. Middle-click to close.
 
> *How did you extract the bitmaps?*
